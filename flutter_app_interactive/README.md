# flutter_app_interactive

A Flutter application that gives 3 approaches with user interaction.

Class TapboxA can manage its own state so it extends StatefulWidget class.

Class TapboxB's state is managed by its parent widget so Class TapboxA is StatelessWidget and its parent class extends StatefulWidget.

Class TapBoxC uses a mix-and-match approach. Its border is managed by itself while the color is managed by its parent class.
